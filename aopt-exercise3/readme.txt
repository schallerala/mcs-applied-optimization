Programming Exercise: Mass Spring System

It took a considerable time to understand the code structure and what was expected where. But with the help of the website
to visualise the system, the tests and the additional informations given by the assistant we were able to complete
all todos implementations.

A few computation might be more optimized to avoid a few duplicate math computation, but we rely on the compiler to
identify those to keep the code clearer.

A small script was used to compute all derivation of this series: https://jsfiddle.net/5f90xtye/1/

All given tests are green
